    <h1> Overview </h1>
    <p>
      Scalable Informatics for Biomedical Imaging Studies (SIBIS) CNS<sup>LAB</sup> is a platform of linked and interoperable technologies for the management, analysis, and sharing of biomedical imaging data. The platform contributes new technologies
      that advance the
      understanding of normal biological structure and function and disease processes. SIBIS is central to the analysis performed by the
      <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/brainaddictionlab.html">Brain Addiction Laboratory</a> (a joint research effort between SRI
      International and Stanford University) and its collaborators.

<p>Building upon XNAT and REDCap, SIBIS automates electronic data capture, management, harmonization, quality control, analysis, and distribution of data collected by cross-sectional, single site as well as longitudinal, multi-site studies.
  All data collected using electronic data capture (e.g. <a href="https://webcnp.med.upenn.edu/">WebCNP</a>, <a href="https://www.limesurvey.org">LimeSurvey</a>, <a href="http://www.blaise.com">Blaise</a>, <a
    href="http://www.pstnet.com/eprime.cfm">ePrime</a>, and REDCap) are merged into a REDCap server hosted at SRI. Data items captured on laptops are automatically extracted, transformed into a compliant format, and loaded into REDCap from a secure
  and encrypted Subversion version control system. Imaging data is first uploaded from the collection site specific Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) to a XNAT server hosted at SRI. All data is evaluated with quality control checks
  that includes automatic test scoring, range validation, and a neuroradiologist report for incidental imaging findings. Issues identified during quality control are reported to the collection site. Once data passed the initial quality control, the
  data is processed for further analyses and backed up via Amazon Web Services (AWS). To distribute the processed data, SIBIS the platform has an integrated data release mechanism, which includes compliance with Neuroimaging Data Model (NIDM),
  enrichment with ontologies such as the Cognitive Atlas, and automatic uploads to data repositories such as Synapse.</p>
